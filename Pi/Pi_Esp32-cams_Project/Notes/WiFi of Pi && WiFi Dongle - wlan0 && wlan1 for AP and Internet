Wifi of Pi && WiFi Dongle / wlan0 && wlan1 for AP and Internet:
step by step Guide->

[0] Identify interfaces
>> ip a 
- you should see both wlan0 and wlan1

>> iw dev
-to confirm which is which

>> iwlist wlan1 scan
-test it 

>> ip a 
- look for your usb wifi dongle - it should be named something like wlan1

>>lsusb 
- if its missing, run lsusb

[1] 

>> sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-wlan1.conf

- Paste :
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
country=GR

network={
    ssid="PROGNOSIS_GUEST"
    psk="2410623922"
}
----
Ctrl+O -> Enter -> Ctrl+X
----

Now bring up the interface and connect:

>> sudo wpa_supplicant -B -i wlan1 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-wlan1.conf

IF you have RFKILL: wlan soft block . or generally rfkill and block you can check ->

>> rfkill list all 
- to see which is blocked or not.
>> sudo rfkill unblock all
>> rfkill list all 
- recheck

NEXT:

>> sudo ip link set wlan1 up
- bring up the interface and connect

>> sudo wpa_supplicant -B -i wlan1 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf [ without -wlan1 this time !?!]
- connect again to wpa_supplicant

>> sudo dhclient wlan1
- if it sends ERROR: IpV4 Address already assigned its because it has already an IP
