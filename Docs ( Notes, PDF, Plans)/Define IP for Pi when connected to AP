Wifi IP Change Manually for ESP32-AP from Pi. 

Because the IP changes when it connects for Pi . we need it to have
the same or something like it to connect and show the cameras .
when connected it had 10.42.22.X type of IP. 

we use those commands : 

nmcli con mod "ESP32-AP" ipv4.address 192.168.4.100/24 
nmcli con mod "ESP32-AP" ipv4.gateway 192.168.4.1
nmcli con mod "ESP32-AP" ipv4.method manual
nmcli con up "ESP32-AP" 

those 4 lines .

nmcli : Network Manager CLI -> manually assign a statip IP 

line 1 : 
sets a static IP address for the Pi's wifi interface
when connected to "ESP32-AP".
192.168.4.100 is your Pi's address.
/24 means the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0

line 2 :
Sets the default gateway for the connection -- in this case , 
the ESP32-AP (usually at .1)
[even if there is no internet , setting this helps routing within 
the network ]

line 3 : 
Tells NetworkManager not to use DHCP,but to use the manual/static IP
we defined above.

line 4 : 
Bring up the connection to the access point immediately,applying
the manual IP/gateway settings.
